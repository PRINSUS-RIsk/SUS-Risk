# Project Overview

The "Towards a holistic approach to sustainable risk management in agriculture" (SUS-RISK) project is a three-year research initiative funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) through the Projects of Relevant National Interest (PRIN) 2020 program (Grant No. 20205L79R8). Running from June 2022 to May 2025, the project aims to enhance knowledge in agricultural risk management through a holistic approach that investigates all relevant aspects affecting risk management choices using cutting-edge methodologies.

## Research Challenge

Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors, exposed to a plethora of risks caused by weather, pests and diseases, price volatility, changes in government policies, global markets instability, and other factors. These risks lead to wide volatility in farmers' income and wellbeing, making it difficult to make predictions and optimal decisions. Furthermore, experiences of negative events reduce farmers' willingness to invest and innovate, which negatively affects productivity and competitiveness across the entire agri-food value chain.

The state of knowledge on Risk Management (RM) in agriculture remains partial, and the current approach is evolving to address multi-faced global challenges: climate change, more frequent extreme events, unstable and volatile markets, food security needs, and food safety threats. A holistic approach is needed because the scientific literature has not fully accounted for the complex and intervening factors affecting RM decisions in a coherent and connected set of research activities.

## Research Objectives

The SUS-RISK project aims to fill knowledge gaps through a holistic approach and cutting-edge methodologies with the following specific objectives:

1. To enhance knowledge in agricultural risk management using comprehensive and integrated research methods
2. To quantify and qualify agricultural risks considering their dynamic nature and evolution under climate change, policies, and agro-environmental regulations
3. To analyze how behavioral factors affect farmers' adoption of risk management strategies through contextualized economic experiments
4. To explore the determinants of risk management choices using advanced methodologies like Machine Learning, discrete choice experiments, and structural equation modeling
5. To develop feasibility studies for innovative risk management tools envisaged by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
6. To analyze potential implications of new policies, risk management tools, and risk scenarios for farm sustainability
