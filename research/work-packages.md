## WP1: Risk Qualification and Quantification
**Lead Institution:** University of Tuscia  
**Objective:** Develop comprehensive risk analysis considering current conditions, environmental constraints, and climate change impacts.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 1.a** - Whole farm risk analysis using Vector Auto-Regressive analysis
- **Task 1.b** - Assessment of environmental constraint impacts on farm risk
- **Task 1.c** - Climate change risk evaluation using quantile regressions

### Description:
This work package focuses on the qualification and quantification of agricultural risks through innovative analytical approaches. It addresses the dynamic dimension affecting risk management choices and introduces causality assessment through panel Vector Auto-Regressive analysis. The work package investigates the relationship between chemical use and agricultural production risk, particularly in light of the Farm-to-Fork strategy's environmental targets.

## WP2: Behavioral Factors in Risk Management
**Lead Institution:** University of Trento  
**Objective:** Analyze how behavioral factors affect farmers' adoption of risk management strategies through incentivized economic experiments.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 2.a** - Mapping out the role of behavioral factors on farmers' decision to adopt risk management strategies
- **Task 2.b** - Elicitation of behavioral factors affecting farmers' adoption of risk management strategies

### Description:
This work package conducts systematic review of international literature investigating behavioral factors' influence on farmers' risk management decisions. It employs incentivized economic experiments to elicit farmers' subjective probabilities, risk and ambiguity attitudes, loss aversion, and time preferences. The experiments are designed as both contextualized and non-contextualized to test external validity.

## WP3: Explaining Risk Management Choices
**Lead Institution:** University of Tuscia (Task 3.a), University of Trento (Task 3.b), University of Padova (Task 3.c)  
**Objective:** Analyze traditional and innovative risk management tools to understand farmer participation and preferences.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 3.a** - Assessing the determinants of participation in insurance schemes using Machine Learning
- **Task 3.b** - Farmers' preferences for characteristics of innovative RM tools
- **Task 3.c** - Determinants of the adoption of innovative RM tools

### Description:
This work package employs Machine Learning approaches (Shrinkage and Boosting) to explore factors affecting farmers' participation in insurance schemes. It investigates farmers' preferences for innovative risk management tools through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) and develops comprehensive frameworks to explain adoption decisions using structural equation modeling.

## WP4: Feasibility Studies and Design of Innovative Risk Management Tools
**Lead Institution:** University of Padova (Task 4.a), University of Foggia (Task 4.b)  
**Objective:** Develop feasibility studies for innovative crisis measures and risk management tools envisaged by the new Common Agricultural Policy.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 4.a** - Feasibility study of innovative crisis measures and RM tools envisaged by the new CAP
- **Task 4.b** - Feasibility study on weather-indexed and catastrophe insurances

### Description:
This work package develops feasibility studies for new CAP measures including national basic coverage against catastrophic events and new reserve funds for crises. It focuses on weather-indexed insurance and catastrophe insurance for wheat and tomato crops, using quantile regressions to investigate trigger mechanisms and pricing models for extreme events.

## WP5: Potential Implications of New Policies, RM Tools and Risk Scenarios
**Lead Institution:** University Cattolica (Task 5.a), University of Padova (Task 5.b), University of Tuscia (Task 5.c)  
**Objective:** Assess the potential implications of introducing new policies, risk management instruments, and risk scenarios.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 5.a** - Impact of risk management choices on the use of chemicals
- **Task 5.b** - Assessing farmers' preferences for contract farming
- **Task 5.c** - Assessing potential impact through Positive Mathematical Programming models

### Description:
This work package investigates the interaction between risk management tools and agricultural policy objectives, particularly the relationship between chemical use reduction and risk management. It examines contract farming as a risk reduction mechanism and uses PMP models to simulate impacts of innovative RM tools on farm production choices and economic performance.

## WP6: Stakeholder Engagement, Exploitation and Dissemination
**Lead Institution:** University of Tuscia (coordination), All institutions  
**Objective:** Ensure strong stakeholder engagement and maximize exploitation and dissemination of project results.

### Key Tasks:
- **Task 6.a** - Stakeholder engagement through focus groups and continuous interaction
- **Task 6.b** - Exploitation and dissemination of results

### Description:
This work package ensures continuous engagement with farmers, policymakers, insurance sector institutions, and other stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. It includes 5 focus groups, development of policy briefs in English and Italian, creation of a project website, social media dissemination, and organization of seminars and conferences to present results.

### Stakeholder Engagement Activities:
- Focus groups with farmers, policymakers, and insurance companies
- Policy briefs for easy-to-read communication of findings
- Project website in English and Italian
- Twitter dissemination campaigns
- Mid-term and final seminars/conferences
- Publication of comprehensive project book

## WP7: Project and Data Management
**Lead Institution:** University of Tuscia  
**Objective:** Ensure high-quality project management, data security, and coordination among research units.

### Key Tasks:
- Project coordination and monitoring
- Data management and security protocols
- Communication and collaboration frameworks
- Quality assurance and peer review processes

### Description:
This work package establishes management procedures including progress monitoring, communication protocols, risk management, decision-making processes, and conflict resolution. It ensures high-quality approach adherence to ethics rules, and maintains shared workspace for data availability and security among partners.

### Management Activities:
- Bi-annual steering committee meetings
- Internal peer-to-peer review process for deliverables
- Shared cloud workspace for data management
- Ethical approval coordination across research units
- World Café approach for enhanced interaction
