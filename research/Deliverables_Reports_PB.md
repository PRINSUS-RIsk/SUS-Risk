## WP2: Behavioural factors influencing farmers' adoption of risk management strategies

### Description:

This work package conducts systematic review of international literature investigating behavioral factors' influence on farmers' risk management decisions. It employs incentivized economic experiments to elicit farmers' subjective probabilities, risk and ambiguity attitudes, loss aversion, and time preferences. The experiments are designed as both contextualized and non-contextualized to test external validity.
